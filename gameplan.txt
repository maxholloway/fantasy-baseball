Plan for making neural nets for each player

1.) Figure out features
			Batters:
				Batting
					Left vs right
				Average stolen bases
				Pitcher
					Fly ball pitcher
					...
				Ballpark (maybe not)
			
2.) Get data
			Get new CSV files for batters
			Get the data for the individual player
			
			Start with the player's data:
				Batting average
				Average strikeouts
				Average walks
				Average stolen bases
				

3.) Instantiate neural net
			Start with small neural net
